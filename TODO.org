* Goal
  - Implement the SRP-tree from the paper: https://link-springer-com.uml.idm.oclc.org/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-47804-2_7
  - Identify areas of improvement:
    - Can it be optimized?
    - It does not include what it calls "non-rare rare patterns" in the algorithm, how can this be included?
* Work Break Down
** Define algorithm
** Implement algorithm
